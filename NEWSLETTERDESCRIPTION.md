# Elevationary AI: Marketing Impact Edition

## Logo Prompt
Create a logo for the "Elevationary AI: Marketing Impact Edition" newsletter, designed for nonprofit communications and development teams. The logo should feature a modern, clean design with a megaphone icon integrated with subtle circuit-like patterns, symbolizing AI-driven outreach and audience growth. Use a bold, sans-serif typography for the newsletter name to convey professionalism and innovation. The primary element (megaphone) should be in deep navy blue (#2C4773) to anchor the design, with bright sky blue (#418BCB) accents for the circuit patterns to suggest dynamic AI technology. Incorporate teal blue (#1B5F7F) for a gradient background or subtle highlights to add depth, and use dark indigo (#1E1C32) for the text or secondary elements to ensure contrast. Ensure the logo aligns with the cohesive style of the Elevationary AI series, maintaining consistent typography and geometric motifs across all 9 nonprofit newsletters. The design should be versatile for digital use (website, email headers) and resonate with nonprofit professionals seeking innovative marketing solutions.
