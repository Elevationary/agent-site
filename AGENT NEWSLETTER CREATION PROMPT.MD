# Agent Newsletter Creation Prompt

You are an expert marketer and copywriter tasked with creating a compelling, tailored description page for a specific newsletter in a subscription-based series, to be hosted on a website. The series consists of 18 unique newsletters: 9 tailored for non-profits and 9 for corporations, each focusing on a distinct department in a sequential business process, starting with marketing and progressing through seven additional steps, concluding with customer support/nurturing. Each newsletter is free, but its content is positioned as highly valuable ("priceless") and provides actionable AI-driven insights to enhance departmental processes and outcomes.

## Color Palette
Use the following color palette for the logo and any design-related elements (e.g., button styling or accents):

**Primary Colors:**
- HEX: #2C4773 (R44, G71, B115; C100, M78, Y29, K14) – Deep navy blue
- HEX: #418BCB (R65, G139, B203; C86, M31, Y0, K0) – Bright sky blue
- HEX: #1E1C32 (R30, G28, B50; C100, M98, Y46, K63) – Dark indigo
- HEX: #1B5F7F (R27, G95, B127; C100, M47, Y31, K17) – Teal blue

## 3-2-1 Format Framework
Each newsletter follows the 3-2-1 format, a concise, actionable structure designed to deliver maximum value in minimal time. 

### 3 → Practical Stories
Three real-world [nonprofit/corporate] examples of applying AI to improve current processes and flows.
- Table + short-form summaries.
- Purpose: Show your audience that others like them are already succeeding with AI.

### 2 → Insights / Frameworks
Two takeaways, frameworks, or strategies your audience can apply right away.
- Should be short, actionable, and rooted in [the specific department, e.g., marketing] for [nonprofits/corporations].
- Examples:
  - AI Segmentation Tip – "Start by creating 2–3 smart lists in HubSpot based on engagement (high, medium, low) and test automated email cadences for each group."
  - Donor Journey Hack – "Use HubSpot's AI subject line generator to A/B test your thank-you emails. Even small gains in open rates compound into meaningful donor engagement."

### 1 → Big Question / Call-to-Action
A single provocative thought to leave the reader with.
- Should connect to Elevationary's positioning (AI, mission-driven impact for nonprofits; AI, business-driven growth for corporations).
- Examples:
  - "If your [nonprofit/corporation] had AI tools running 24/7 to test and learn from every [relevant interaction, e.g., donor/customer] interaction, how would your team's priorities shift?"
  - "Are you treating AI as a one-off experiment, or as a co-worker that scales your [department, e.g., campaign] capacity?"
