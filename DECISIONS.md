# Decisions (ADRs – lightweight)

## ADR-001 — HSTS scope (2025-10-24)
Decision: Enable HSTS max-age 30d, no includeSubDomains, no preload.  
Why: Reduce risk across subdomains while gaining baseline security.  
Status: Accepted.

## ADR-002 — Agent micro-site strategy (2025-10-24)
Decision: Keep human UX on Google Sites; host agent/AEO pages on Cloudflare Pages with JSON-LD, sitemap, robots.  
Why: Sites blocks <script>, Pages gives control and speed; keeps human UX separate.  
Status: Accepted.

# Decisions Log


## 2025-10-30 — Canonical SEO, Sitemap, and Cache Policy (supersedes portions of 2025-10-27)

**Canonical strategy**
- Product pages (e.g., `/consulting-60/`) use absolute canonical: `https://agent.elevationary.com/<slug>/`.
- Root catalog (`/`) remains `noindex,follow` and keeps self-canonical `https://agent.elevationary.com/`.
- Staging path `/p/*` retired. `_redirects` entries for `/consulting-60` → `/p/consulting-60` removed. No `/p` generation in build.
- JSON-LD is page-level only (provided via page front matter / `head_jsonld`); **not** emitted from `base.njk`.

**Sitemap logic**
- Single sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` generated by `src/sitemap.njk`.
- Each entry derives `<loc>` from the page’s canonical URL.
- `<lastmod>` is taken from page front matter `lastmod` when present, otherwise from the page date.
- Current canonical page in sitemap: `/consulting-60/` with `lastmod` `2025-10-29`. Confirmed live.

**Cache policy**
- HTML pages: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (active iteration mode). Revisit to `max-age=600` after stabilization.
- Assets under `/assets/`: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- `/sitemap.xml`: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, must-revalidate` via `_headers`.
- Security headers remain as documented; HSTS 30d applies at zone level.

**Verification cues**
- `curl -sL https://agent.elevationary.com/consulting-60/ | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -oi '<link[^>]*rel=.canonical[^>]*>'`
- `curl -sL https://agent.elevationary.com/sitemap.xml | sed -n '1,40p'`
- `curl -sI https://agent.elevationary.com/sitemap.xml | grep -i cache-control`

## 2025-10-27 — Harvest from MiniMVP outline (two files)

**Platform & Hosting**
- Static site architecture with Eleventy (11ty) as the generator — **Accepted (implementation in progress)**
- Deploy on **Cloudflare Pages**; custom domain: `agent.elevationary.com`.

**DNS & TLS**
- Both **elevationary.com** and **elevationary.ai** on **Cloudflare DNS**.
- **SSL/TLS** Cloudflare Full (Strict) for the elevationary.com zone (applies to all proxied hosts: apex, www, agent). Universal SSL (edge cert) covers elevationary.com and *.elevationary.com.
- **HSTS** enabled at 30 days; no subdomains; preload off (revisit later). (Enabled on .com; .ai relies on redirect and does not serve its own content.)

**Redirects**
- **Global `.ai` → `www.elevationary.com`** redirect via Cloudflare Rules, preserving path/query.

**AEO / ACP Conventions**
- Product pages (e.g., `/consulting-60/`) are **index,follow** with constrained previews (Googlebot parity).
- Root catalog (`/`) is **noindex,follow** to avoid human SERP clutter.
- **JSON-LD**: stable `Organization @id`, `Product @id`, `offers.url` points to **Google Booking**, Stripe **Pay Link** exposed via `additionalProperty.paymentLink`.
- Googlebot meta mirrors robots with: noarchive, max-snippet:0, max-image-preview:none.


**Caching & Headers**
- HTML (strategy): target Cache-Control: public, max-age=600
- HTML (current): Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate (temporary to avoid early staleness; revisit when comfortable)
- Assets: Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
- Security: X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, minimal Permissions-Policy.


**Verification**
- Search Console (URL-prefix) for `agent.elevationary.com` via **HTML file**; **sitemap** submitted.

**Email Posture**
- `.com`: SPF (Google), DKIM (Google), DMARC `p=none` (CF aggregate reports).
- `.ai`: Cloudflare Email Routing (SPF/DKIM/DMARC for routing) forwarding to `@elevationary.com`.

**Governance**
- Keep **agent** subdomain unlinked from human site (exposure policy).
- Revisit **PR discipline** once base stabilizes.

## ADR-003 — Change control posture (2025-10-24)
Decision: Permit direct-to-main commits during foundation work; re-enable PR discipline when stable.
Why: Speed now, governance later.
Status: Accepted — review in ~1 week.

## ADR-004 — DNS provider consolidation (2025-10-24)
Decision: Move elevationary.com and elevationary.ai authoritative DNS to Cloudflare.
Why: Unified control for Pages, Rules, Email Routing, security posture.
Status: Accepted (completed).

## ADR-005 — Email routing for .ai (2025-10-24)
Decision: Use Cloudflare Email Routing for @elevationary.ai forwarding to @elevationary.com; CF-managed DMARC aggregate.
Why: Simplify forwarding; consistent SPF/DKIM/DMARC posture.
Status: Accepted (completed).

## 2025-10-27 — Commercial & Tracking Defaults

**Product pricing (60‑minute consult)**
- Set price to **$399.00 USD**; review quarterly and align Stripe Pay Link + Calendar price.

**Receipts fallback**
- Add this sentence to Stripe receipt email/template:  
  “If you weren’t redirected to scheduling after payment, book here: https://calendar.app.google/FLe6Q6WzHQkHRK7v7”

**UTM convention for Pay Links**
- Append `?utm_source=site&utm_medium=consulting&utm_campaign=60min` to the 60‑minute Stripe Pay Link.  
- Mirror the pattern for other durations (e.g., `...&utm_campaign=30min`, `...&utm_campaign=90min`) when added.

**AEO/ACP mapping (confirmation)**
- Keep policy: `offers.url` → Google Booking (human flow).  
- Expose Stripe Pay Link for agents/ACP via JSON‑LD `additionalProperty.paymentLink`.
