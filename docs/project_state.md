# Project State: Elevationary Agent Site
*The Revenue Engine.*

## Current Status
- **Phase:** 4. AI Optimization
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-19
- **Archetype:** Platform (Revenue Engine)

## Active Context
- **Goal:** Transform the site into an "AI Visible" commerce engine (ACP/UCP).
- **Architecture:** Eleventy (SSG) + Cloudflare (Edge) + HubSpot (CRM) + Stripe ($$).
- **Recent Wins:**
    - **Robots:** Unblocked `GPTBot` (Visibility 100%).
    - **Intelligence:** Hydrated standard Directives (`Gemini.md`).
    - **AEO:** `FAQPage` schema populated and validated.
    - **Environment:** Functional Python `venv` with `pypdf`.
    - **GEO Identity:** `Organization` and `FAQPage` schema injected. `index.html` visible.
    - **Protocols:** ACP (`ai-plugin.json`) and UCP (`ucp.json`) live.

    - **Pages:** `About` and `Legal` pages deployed.
    - **Gatekeeper:** `/premium/` route protected by Cloudflare Middleware. `Unlock` page live.
    - **Documentation:** Created `STRIPE_SETUP.md` for user handover.

## Next Steps (High Priority)
*   [ ] **Gatekeeper Activation:** Configure Stripe Keys and debug Cloudflare Middleware.
*   [ ] **Content Engine:** Begin Phase 2 (Newsletters) once gating is verified.
*   [ ] **Validation:** Verify `ai-plugin.json` propagation.

## Known Issues
- **None.** Workspace is clean and verified (`OPS-CHECKS` passing).
